# Advanced Control

### Auto Detect Configurations

The plugin will scan for all your devices and retrieve each device capabilities separately. that means, that in HomeKit you will see only the things that the Sensibo app allows you to control.

In practice:

- Minimum and Maximum temperatures are taken from Sensibo api.
- Temperature unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit) is taken from Sensibo api.
- "AUTO" mode is available in the AC states in HomeKit only if it is available in Sensibo app.
- Modes "FAN" and "DRY" (dehumidifier) will create their own accessories only if you have this ability inside Sensibo app.
- Fan Speed ("Rotation Speed" in Home app) And Swing ("Oscillate" in Home app) will show in the accessory settings, but only if you have this capability in Sensibo app.
- "Horizontal" Swing capability in Sensibo app will show up as a normal switch in HomeKit (because there is no other way to control horizontal swing at the moment)
- **NEW! -**  use `"ignoreHomeKitDevices": true` to automatically ignore, skip or remove HomeKit supported devices like Sensibo Air and Sensibo Pure.

### State Polling

The accessory state will be updated in the background every 90 seconds, this is hard coded and requested specifically by Sensibo company.
The state will also refresh every time you open the "Home" app or any related HomeKit app.

### Fan Mode

If your Sensibo app can control your AC **FAN** mode, this plugin will create extra fan accessory in HomeKit to control the FAN mode of your device.<br>
it will also include all the fan speeds and swing possibilities you have for FAN mode.

To disable the extra fan accessory, add `"disableFan": true` to your config.

### Dry Mode

If your Sensibo app can control your AC **DRY** mode, this plugin will create extra dehumidifier accessory in HomeKit to control the DRY mode of your device.<br>
it will also include all the fan speeds and swing possibilities you have for DRY mode.

To disable the extra dehumidifier accessory, add `"disableDry": true` to your config.

### Disable AUTO mode

To disable an AC's AUTO mode, add `"disableAuto": true` to your config.

### Horizontal Swing

If your Sensibo app has **Horizontal Swing** control, this plugin will create extra switch accessory in HomeKit to control it.
To disable the extra horizontal swing  switch accessory, add `"disableHorizontalSwing": true` to your config.

### AC Sync Button

Does Sensibo shows your AC is ON while it's actually OFF?<br>
Does your sensibo state get out of sync with your AC?<br>
Do you find yourself changing commands from the original remote just for the AC and Sensibo to be in sync?

if you found yourself struggling with the above, this feature is exactly for you!
It allows you to quickly toggle the state in Sensibo and Home app without changing the real state of your device, this will help you to quickly sync between them.

When enabled, this feature creates a new switch accessory in HomeKit. The new switch is stateless, which means that when clicked, it turns back OFF after 1 second. behind the scenes, the plugin changes the state of the device from ON to OFF or the other way around, depends on the current state of the device. all of that, without sending actual commands to the AC! so you can relax while you test this button :)

\* *it is extra necessary if your AC has the same command for ON and  OFF because it can go out of sync easily.*


**To enable the extra "AC Sync" switch**, add 
`"enableSyncButton": true` to your config.

**To attach the "AC Sync" button as a service to the AC accessory instead of a separate switch**, add 
`"syncButtonInAccessory": true` to your config.


### Occupancy Sensor
Enabling this feature will add **Occupancy Sensor** to HomeKit, representing the Home/Away state of the geofence feature in Sensibo app.

*Geofencing must be enabled in Sensibo app for it to work

**To enable the extra occupancy sensor**, add 
`"enableOccupancySensor": true` to your config.

### Climate React Switch
When enabled, this feature creates a new switch accessory in HomeKit. The new switch can quickly enable or disable the state of the "Climate React" you've set in Sensibo app.<br>


Use this feature in conjunction with the occupancy sensor and you'll be able to get the "Sensibo Plus" feature that allows turning it on/off according to your geolocation. 

*This feature does not allow changing the actual logic of the "Climate React" but only make it enabled or disabled. Therefore, it will not work if the "Climate React" was not set up in Sensibo app.

**To enable a Climate React switch**, add 
`"enableClimateReactSwitch": true` to your config.

### Climate React Auto Setup
When enabled, every time an AC's state is set or changed,  appropriate Climate React configuration will be set up for maintaining the desired temperature.

For example, if setting an AC to Cool to 25C, Climate React will be set up such that when the temperature rises above 25C the AC starts to cool and when the temperature drops below 24 (the target temperature minus 1 degress centigrade, or the equivalent fahrenheit delta), the AC will be turned off.

When setting an AC to Heat with a target temprature, Climate React will be set up similarly.

**To enable Climate React Auto Setup**, add 
`"enableClimateReactAutoSetup": true` to your config.

### Filter Cleaning Indication

If you have the Filter Cleaning notifications feature in Sensibo (from Sensibo "Plus" subscription or via old account) it will appear in the AC settings in HomeKit in this form:

1. **Filer Life Level** - Relative (0-100%) representation of the filter life level. calculated from the last time it was cleaned until the next time it should be clean
2. **Filter Change Indication** - Boolean state represent whether the filter should be cleaned or not (based on usage time).
3. **Reset Filter Indication** - Stateless button appears only in Eve app that resets the counter of the filter life. normally you would click this button right after you cleaned the filters.


### History Storage
Enabling this feature will keep all measurements of temperature and humidity and will store them. Then, all the historic data will be viewable in Eve app under the accessory in a nice graph.

**To enable the history storage feature**, add 
`"enableHistoryStorage": true` to your config.

### Fan speeds & "AUTO" speed
Fan speed steps are determined by the steps you have available in the Sensibo app. Since HomeKit control over fan speed is with a slider between 0-100, the plugin converts the steps you have in the Sensibo app to values between 1 to 100, when 100 is highest and 1 is lowest. if "AUTO" speed is available in your setup, setting the fan speed to 0, should actually set it to "AUTO" speed.

### Issues & Debug
If you experience any issues with the plugins please refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/nitaybz/homebridge-sensibo-ac/issues) tab or [Sensibo-AC Discord channel](https://discord.gg/yguuVAX) and check if your issue is already described there, if it doesn't, please create a new issue with as much detailed information as you can give (logs are crucial).<br>

if you want to even speed up the process, you can add `"debug": true` to your config, which will give me more details on the logs and speed up fixing the issue.
